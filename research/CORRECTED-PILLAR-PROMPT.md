# CORRECTED GEMINI PROMPT: Automation-Ready Web Development PILLAR PAGE

## üß† SEQUENTIAL REASONING REQUIRED
**Use advanced sequential reasoning for this complex task. Apply this format:**
- üîç **ANALYSIS**: Break down the pillar page requirements and technical constraints
- üìã **PLAN**: Structure the content layout, visual elements, and sub-article integration  
- üß† **REASONING**: Think through the optimal information architecture and user experience
- ‚ö° **EXECUTION**: Create the complete .astro file with all requirements
- ‚úÖ **VERIFICATION**: Check compliance with anti-text-wall rules and accessibility standards

## CRITICAL: This is a PILLAR PAGE HUB, NOT a regular blog article!

You are creating a **PILLAR PAGE HUB** that serves as the central hub for 5 sub-articles. This is NOT a regular blog article format.

### REQUIRED STRUCTURE (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

**MUST examine `/src/pages/blog/business-process-automation-services.astro` to understand the correct pillar page layout!**

#### Layout Requirements:
- **Grid layout**: `lg:grid-cols-3` (left column spans 2, right column spans 1)
- **Left Column**: Main comprehensive content (2,400+ words)
- **Right Column**: Sub-article hub with prominent cards for all 5 sub-articles
- **Hero Section**: Large title with comprehensive description
- **Table of Contents**: Expandable TOC section
- **Full Content**: Complete pillar page content, not abbreviated

#### File Structure:
```astro
---
import Layout from '../../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Footer from '../../components/Footer.astro';
import WireframeBackground from '../../components/WireframeBackground.astro';

// Sub-articles for this pillar (MUST include all 5)
const pillarArticles = [
```

**CRITICAL SYNTAX NOTE**: Use regular single quotes (') in import statements, NOT escaped quotes (\\'). The imports must be exactly:
- `'../../layouts/Layout.astro'` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- `\\'../../layouts/Layout.astro\\'` ‚ùå WRONG - causes syntax errors
